This project, which was related to our university, involved four of us as group members and a mentor who provided support throughout the project. The topic was primarily based on Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing, and it even aimed to develop a system that can track a driver's health in real time and take preventative measures to reduce accidents caused by driving impairment, distraction, or drowsiness. It was progressing with the AI system's driver state detection and adding an early warning system, i.e., a virtual assistant using NLP, testing and validating the system's efficaciousness, and integrating the system in different vehicles. It was a large-scale project that dealt with hardware and software while guaranteeing compliance with pertinent safety norms and standards.
